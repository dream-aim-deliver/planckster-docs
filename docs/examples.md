Let's discover **Source Code Examples**.

## Kubeflow Notebooks

To view all available notebooks, visit the [Notebooks tab](https://kubeflow.devmaany.com/_/jupyter/?ns=planckster-example) in the Kubeflow UI. 
Once you have selected a notebook, you can view its details, and click on "Connect" to interact with the notebook whenever you're ready:

- The [Kernel Planckster example notebook](https://kubeflow.devmaany.com/jupyter/notebook/details/planckster-example/example-kernel-planckster) tos show to connect to Kernel Planckster and view the scraped data obtained when running the Kubeflow pipelines. For more information on Kernel Planckster's API, please refer to the [corresponding guide](./guides/kernel/kernel-planckster-api-walkthrough/index.md)

- The [Disaster tracking example notebook](https://kubeflow.devmaany.com/_/jupyter/notebook/details/planckster-example/sda-disaster-tracking-demos?ns=planckster-example) shows how to get the data and run cv plotting and sutff like that

scraper notebooks exemplify how to get the data from the sources. You can build your own scraper notebook to get data from a new source.
