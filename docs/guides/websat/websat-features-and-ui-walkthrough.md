# Introduction to Websat Planckster

:::info Coming soon!

  This guide will cover the features of Websat Planckster, which is a webserver that allows users to interact with Kernel Planckster.
  This implies that, through Websat, users can view and download the data stored in Kernel Planckster, obtained via the Kubeflow pipelines and data scrapers.

  Additionally, Websat Planckster will allow us to create new instances of our [core concepts](../../concepts/core-concepts/index.md), such as a Research Context and a Conversation, which will then allow us to use an LLM to interact with the data via a chat interface.
