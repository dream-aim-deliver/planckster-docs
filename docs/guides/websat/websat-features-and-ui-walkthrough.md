# Introduction to Websat Planckster

[This instructional video](https://youtu.be/5tKNrb03Pr0) guide covers the features of Websat Planckster, which is a webserver that allows users to interact with Kernel Planckster. Through Websat, users can view and download the data stored in [Kernel Planckster](../../category/kernel-planckster), obtained via the [Kubeflow pipelines](../kubeflow/running-kubeflow-pipelines.md) and [data scrapers](../../category/data-scrapers). The Websat interface also gives users the ability to upload their own data manually, as well.

In fact, new instances of any of the our [core concepts](../../concepts/core-concepts/index.md) can be created through Websat Planckster, allowing us to use an LLM to interact with the data via a chat interface.

So check out [our video](https://youtu.be/5tKNrb03Pr0) to start exploring Websat Planckster!
